title: Ask Any AI Chatbot - New android app
comments: true
---

I was tired of having to install multiple apps for each AI chatbot I wanted to use, so I created an app that allowd you to access the best AI chatbots easily from one android app. I've called it **Ask Any AI Chatbot**.

The full list of chatbots it can current access is:
* ChatGPT
* Gemini
* Perplexity AI
* Microsoft Copilot
* Claude
* Llama2
* Hugging Face
* Minstrel

You can download the free android version ![here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.backproplabs.ask_any_ai_chatbot) and the ad free version ![here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.backproplabs.ask_any_ai_chatbot.paid)


Leave a comment if you would like a chatbot added to the list.
